# Fluid-Flow-Classification-in-Python

**Fluid Flow Classification Based on Reynolds Number**

**Objective:**

This project aims to develop a Python-based application to classify fluid flow regimes (laminar, transitional, or turbulent) based on the Reynolds number. The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the relative importance of inertial and viscous forces in a fluid flow.

**Methodology:**

**Data Input** 
The user will be prompted to enter the following parameters:

**Fluid density**

**Fluid velocity**

**Pipe diameter**

**Fluid viscosity**

**Reynolds Number Calculation:**

The Reynolds number will be calculated using the formula:

**Re = (density * velocity * diameter) / viscosity**

**Flow Flow Classification:** 

The calculated Reynolds number will be compared to the following thresholds:

Laminar flow: Re <= 2100
Transitional flow: 2100 < Re < 4000
Turbulent flow: Re >= 4000

**Output:** The calculated Reynolds number and the corresponding flow regions (laminar, transitional, or turbulent) will be displayed to the user.

**Python Implementation:**

The provided Python code effectively implements the above methodology. It defines functions to calculate the Reynolds number and classify the flow based on the calculated value. The main() function handles user input and output.

**Expected Outcomes:**

By running the application, users will be able to:

Input fluid properties and pipe dimensions.
Obtain the calculated Reynolds number.
Determine the flow regime (laminar, transitional, or turbulent).

This project provides a solid foundation for understanding and classifying fluid flow regimes based on the Reynolds number. It can be further expanded and 
customized to address specific engineering or research needs.
